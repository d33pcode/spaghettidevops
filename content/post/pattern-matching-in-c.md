The other day i was bored, and I don't know what normal people do when they are bored, but i usually do one thing... code. Actually it all starts with me wondering about some problem, a random problem, then thinking about a solution in my head, and it ends with me implementing it in a random programming language. It all started this way with this little program. I was thinking at how much often i use regular expressions every day on my Linux installation without really knowing how it works. So i decided to get my hands dirty and implement a pattern matching algorithm in c, just to get a better idea of how it all works.

### What the hell is a regular expression
