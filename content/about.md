#### Hey.

As you may have already understood this is a (sort of) blog and we are three IT fanatics. So, nothing new.

Actually we wanted to make something funny - both to write and read - that could be also useful for everyone that is slamming his face against the wall to solve generic IT problems. As we do... did. As we did.

I'm [*streambinder*](https://github.com/streambinder) (Davide Pucci) and I'm not good in writing, at least everything but code. [*d33pcode*](https://github.com/d33pc0d3) (Marco Panunzio) had to write this article, not me, and probably he will review it once he read the shit I wrote. Oh, [*bamless*](https://github.com/bamless) (Fabrizio Pietrucci) is the third fanatic, and he passes time coding and offending *d33pcode*.

This blog is open source, the code can be found on [GitHub](https://github.com/streambinder/spaghettidevops)

We hope you'll enjoy everything that will go around here.

##### \#enjoy.
