### Hey.

As you may have already understood this is a (sort of) blog and we are three IT fanatics. So, nothing new.

Actually we wanted to make something funny - both to write and read - that could be also useful for everyone that is slamming his face against the wall to solve generic IT problems. As we do... did. As we did.

I'm *streambinder* and I'm not good in writing, at least everything but code. *d33pcode* had to write this article, not me, and probably he will review it once he read the shit I wrote. Oh, *bizio* is the third fanatic, and he passes time coding and offending *d33pcode*.

We hope you'll enjoy everything that will go around here.

##### enjoy.
